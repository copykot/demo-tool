### Changes for v1.4.0:
- Made ESP render below players, which massively improves visibility.
- Added voice proximity list as an option. It shows a list of players who are able to hear the target player.
- Added "flashed", "call", and teamspeak (shortened down to "TS") to the list of possible statuses in ESP
- Added a fast-forward keybind in options. Holding the key makes demo playback twice as fast.
- Added NLR to ESP. It only shows up if a player is in their NLR zone.
- Added the player's Steam name to their RP name above their head.
- Whilst in noclip/thirdperson, you can use +left / +right to slowly move the camera.
- Made noclip speed consistent and (kind of) independent of frametime
